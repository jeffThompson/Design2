DESIGN II
====
 
The process of design is built on typography and shape and process, but today is much more than just solutions to visual problems. Design is about problem-making (and solving), responding to the world, offering up new visual ideas, thinking through materials, social responsibility, and communicating ideas between people. This semester, we’ll build on the fundamentals you learned in Design I, but will be focusing on processes that cross the analog/digital divide, and on designing experiences with multiple pages and screens.

>"[We] no longer talk about digital versus analog but instead about modulations of the digital or different intensities of the computational."  
– D. M. Berry

Making is our primary mode of investigation, though we will also conduct visual and design research, and read texts by designers. The goal of this class is wide-ranging exploration, creating surprise, and finding new ways of working with the goal of building your visual vocabulary and starting to find your voice as a designer.

Homework in this class is meant to be exploratory, a way to expand on the experiences and ideas in class. I encourage wide-ranging interpretation of assignments: consider ways that you can fulfill the requirements in a way that is creatively and intellectually exciting for you, not just the obvious requirements. Of course, this is much harder than just reading a chapter or studying for a quiz! I expect considerable engagement from you this semester, and you should expect the material to be rigorous and thorough.

Or, as said by designer and professor Erik Brandt: "I think it is healthy to have certain level of humility and fear. I tell my students when they worry about such feelings, it shows me they are demonstrating care, and care involves a great deal of uncertainty. That means treating your work well - lending it your best craft, your best intentions, your love."

##REQUIRED MATERIALS  
Towards the end of the semester we’ll be working more digitally, but at the start you should bring these supplies every week. Purchase locally, or see [this list](http://a.co/7Bj19NL). Required and suggested readings will be provided as PDFs online – there is no required textbook.

* **Laptop with Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop**  
Demos will be with Creative Cloud 2017. All students will have access to the full Creative Cloud suite free of charge through stevens.edu/vle, though using the Lab computers may be more reliable. If you use your laptop, please don’t forget your charger!
* **Sketchbook**  
At least 5x9” – spiral-bound is best so you can tear out or scan drawings more easily. Please work one-sided only for the same reason.
* **Various drawing/writing implements**  
At least some pencils and pens of various kinds (I really like the Micron Pigma pens for drawing and layout ideation).
* **Digital camera**  
For gathering visual material (phone is ok).
* **Jar of India ink**  
Black, 1–2oz size (Higgins or Speedball brand is very good).
* **At least two medium-sized brushes of different sizes**  
Cheap ones are ok, synthetic bristles will probably be better for ink.
* **Bone folder**  
For folding paper; Teflon ones are fine, if you prefer.
* **Metal ruler**  
At least 12-inches long (15-inches is better), with or without cork backing.
* **Bookbinder’s awl**  
For making holes in paper; a regular carpenters awl may work, but one made for bookbinding will be better.
* **Larger knife with replacement blades**  
Olfa-brand knives are excellent, but a utility knife will work too. Optionally, you may also want an X-Acto knife with replacement blades.
* **Self-healing cutting mat**  
At least 9x12” (we have larger ones, but you should also have your own).
* **Bookbinding needle**  
(The eyes on regular sewing needles are far too small.)
* **Linen thread**  
Doesn’t stretch like normal sewing thread, making for tighter stitches.
* **Various papers and supplies as needed**  
For physical-focused projects and documentation of process.
* **Digital printing**  
At least two projects this semester, printed in the Fab Lab (better option) or locally.
* **Print-on-demand book**  
Cost will vary depending on size, but plan for $15–30 (we’ll be using Blurb since they provide an easy-to-use InDesign plugin).
