DESIGN ELEMENTS BOOK
====

**DUE THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23**

This week, we'll start thinking about designs that have multiple parts, sequence and surprise, and physicality beyond the flat page. Starting with random design elements, your assignment is to make a two-sided accordion book exploring those elements. Size is up to you and a cover is optional, but these choices should be integrated into your design.

**PICKING YOUR ELEMENTS**  
Your list of elements should include:  

* 3 elements randomly selected for you  
* 1 element you pick yourself (the list is in `Resources > DesignElements.md`)  

(If you missed class, please email me for your random elements.)

Your book should be a celebration of the design elements you were given! How can you make a book that is *all* about those elements?

As you design the flow and layout of your book, also think about the ideas listed in Keith Smith's *Structure of the Visual Book* such as repetition, pacing, and pattern.

###FOR NEXT WEEK  
For next week, please bring:

* ~~Printed and finished accordion book (laser printer will probably give you the best results)~~  
* Finished book file, ready for laser printing – we'll spend the first hour of class printing and folding your books (bring your knife, cutting mat, and bone folder too)  
* Some kind of camera for documenting book elements (phone ok), a ruler, your sketchbook, and an up-to-date library account  
* If you want to do any modifications to your Letterform poster following the feedback in class, feel free to do so for next week – please bring them printed for the start of class  

###READING  
Please also read the excerpt from Keith Smith's excellent *Structure of the Visual Book* (found in the `Readings` folder). It will be very helpful thinking about the layout of your book, and upcoming projects.
