DESIGN ELEMENTS BOOK
====

**DUE THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23**

This week, we'll start thinking about designs that have multiple parts, sequence and surprise, and physicality beyond the flat page. Starting with random design elements, your assignment is to make a two-sided accordion book exploring those elements. Size is up to you and a cover is optional, but these choices should be integrated into your design.

**PICKING YOUR ELEMENTS**  
Your list of elements should include:  

* 3 elements randomly selected for you  
* 1 element you pick yourself (the list is in `Resources > DesignElements.md`)  

Your book should be a celebration of the elements you were given! How can you make a book that is *all* about those elements?

As you design the flow and layout of your book, also think about the ideas listed in Keith Smith's *Structure of the Visual Book* such as repetition, pacing, and pattern.

###PRINTING  
The printer setup is a little tricky, so here's a checklist:

* Go to `File > Print...` as usual  
* Select the `Phaser 7100N` printer – under `Page Setup...` change the paper size to tabloid  
* Under `Setup`, change the size to tabloid as well, and the orientation to the way you see it here  
* You'll also want to center the image to make duplex (two-sided) printing easier  
* Under `Marks and Bleed` turn on crop marks, so you can easily trim off the bleed by hand – you can play with the additional printer's marks, if you want :)  

Screenshots of these settings can be found in `Images > Week05`.

###FOR NEXT WEEK  
For next week, please bring:

* Printed and finished accordion book (laser printer will probably give you the best results)  
* Some kind of camera for documenting book elements (phone ok), a ruler, your sketchbook, and an up-to-date library account  

###READING  
Please also read the excerpt from Keith Smith's excellent *Structure of the Visual Book* (found in the `Readings` folder). It will be very helpful thinking about the layout of your book, and upcoming projects.
