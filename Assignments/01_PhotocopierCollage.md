PHOTOCOPIER COLLAGE
====

For our first project of the semester, we're going to work with a tool that is pseudo-physical and pseudo-digital: the [photocopy machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photocopier). For designers of the past, the copy machine was an indispensible tool (I remember spending hours and tons of dimes on copies in art school). Largely replaced by scanners, smartphone cameras, and all-digital workflow, the copier still has a certain analog quality that can't be replicated.

Your assignment is to build a heavily-layered collage using only the copy machine as your tool. Think about what images/objects you want to copy, and how you can use the copy machine creatively to get interesting results. You definitely won't get the collage done in one shot: copy things, cut and layer them, then copy again. The goal is the collaborate with this flawed device to create new visual ideas that you couldn't in Illustrator.

You can also try different copy machines to explore different results: one at Kinkos is probably different than the crappy one in a gas station or bodega.

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

* Copies should be 8.5x11" (though we'll blow this up larger in the final version)  
* Black and white only – no color, please!  
* The photocopier, knife/scissors, glue/tape, and objects/images are the only tools allowed, nothing digital  
* Finished collages should be scanned at 600ppi and saved as TIFF files

**Scanned collages are due next week, January 26th at the start of class.**


### FOR NEXT WEEK
Please bring in your finished collage (scanned as a high-res TIFF file) as well as the copies you made along the way. 

This week you should also purchase the supplies you'll need for the semester (listed in the syllabus and [some here](http://a.co/7Bj19NL)). You won't need everything next week, but be sure to bring:

* India ink  
* Brushes (at least two, but more is always great)  
* At least two alternative materials for mark-making (can be anything)  

You may want to wear clothes that can get dirty next week, as we'll be working with ink.
