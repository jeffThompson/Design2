PHOTOCOPIER COLLAGE
====

> "A photocopier is only a camera with a horizontal surface." – David Hockney  

For our first project of the semester, we're going to work with a tool that is pseudo-physical and pseudo-digital: the [photocopy machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photocopier). For designers of the past, the copy machine was an indispensible tool (I remember spending hours and tons of dimes on copies in art school). Largely replaced by scanners, smartphone cameras, and all-digital workflow, the copier still has a certain analog quality that can't be replicated.

> "Copies are an international visual language, which talks to people in Los Angeles and people in Prague the same way. Making copies is very near to speaking." – Pati Hill  

Your assignment is to build a heavily layered or manipulated collage using only the copy machine as your tool. Think about what images/objects you want to copy, and how you can use the copy machine creatively to get interesting results. You definitely won't get the collage done in one shot: copy things, cut and layer them, then copy again. The goal is the collaborate with this flawed device to create new visual ideas that you couldn't in Illustrator.

You can also try different copy machines to explore different results: one at Kinkos is probably different than the crappy one in a gas station or bodega.

Next week, we'll add type to the scanned copies, turning them into posters, which we'll print and hang in the hall.

### REQUIREMENTS

* Copies should be 8.5x11" (though we'll blow this up larger in the final version)  
* Black and white only – no color, please!  
* The photocopier, knife/scissors, glue/tape, and objects/images are the only tools allowed, nothing digital

### FOR NEXT WEEK
Please bring in your finished collage (scanned as a high-res TIFF file – you may need to install Epson Scan software on your laptop) as well as the copies you made along the way.  

This week you should also purchase the supplies you'll need for the semester (listed in the syllabus and [some here](http://a.co/7Bj19NL)). You won't need everything next week, but be sure to bring:

* India ink  
* Brushes (at least two, but more is always great)  
* At least two alternative materials for mark-making (can be anything)  

You may want to wear clothes that can get dirty next week, as we'll be working with ink.
