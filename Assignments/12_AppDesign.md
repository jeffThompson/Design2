APP DESIGN
====

>"Indifference towards people and the reality in which they live is actually the one and only cardinal sin in design." ― Dieter Rams

For our final project, we're turning our attention from print to screen. Your assignment is to design a mobile app for a graphic design festival put on by [American Institute of Graphic Artists](http://www.aiga.org/) (AIGA). You'll need to think about the paradigms we discussed around books, as well as new affordances offered by the screen, as well as how interactive elements connect, non-linear viewing, and dynamic and animated elements, all while building a beautiful, graphically-satisfying (and perhaps visually challenging) design.

For your final deliverable, you'll be creating a video in Keynote that shows the interaction in your app. This should show:

* A clear, concise description of the app and the design solutions used to arrive at this design  
* At least three screens that serve different functions, and the transitions between them  
* At least two interactive or animated elements in your app  

### PROJECT CALENDAR  
**April 13:** Project launch and [design sprint](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/blob/master/Exercises/DesignSprint.md)  
**April 20:** Screen mockups and interaction diagrams due; animated elements  
**April 27:** Critique of print-on-demand books; work day  
**May 4:** Project updates due; Keynote demos for interactive mockups  
**Friday, May 12 from 9–1:** Projects due, final critique

### FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 20  
This week, we'll build on the [design sprint ideation](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/blob/master/Exercises/DesignSprint.md) we did in class (images of your sliders and drawings [here](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/tree/master/Images/Week12/DesignSprintDrawings)), and end up with some screen mockups and interaction diagrams. Start with paper or the whiteboard as a way of doing quick ["paper prototyping"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping) – speed of iteration is much better than fancy graphics at this point. As Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn said: "If you're not embarassed by the first version of your product, you released too late." You can use the printed templates given out in class, and print more from [the PDF here](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/blob/master/Resources/PhoneTemplate.pdf) (also in the `Resources` folder).

In addition, map out the elements of your app into an [interaction diagram](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/uiFlowDiagram.htm). This should show the pages, transitions, interactive elements, and how everything ties together. This is about mapping logical, non-linear pathways through your app, and creating good user experience. A good way to figure this out is to actually "play-test" your paper prototypes, seeing how someone would actually use your app. You can design your diagram by hand, so long as it can be clearly read, or in Illustrator.

As you're working through this project, you may find Apple's [resources for interface design](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/) very helpful. Their priorities for good interfaces: aesthetic integrity, consitency, direct manipulation, feedback, metaphors, and user control.

**DELIVERABLES FOR NEXT WEEK**  

* At least 20 screen mockup drawings, hand-drawn or printed  
* At least one finished interaction diagram, also drawn or printed  

### FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 27  
This week, keep working on your app designs, considering the feedback you got in class. While there are no specific deliverables for next week, you'll want to make some good headway – next week we'll be looking at how to turn your static Illustrator mockups into video documentation with Keynote.

When you set up your artboards to design the final version of your app, a few things to make sure are set up right when creating your document:

* Your artboard should be 750x1340 pixels, same as the iPhone 6 screen (you can also pick it from the `Mobile > iPhone 6/6s` template section)  
* Be sure `Color Mode` is set to RGB  
* Change `Preview Mode` to `Pixel`

A few other things to get set up:  

* In `Preferences > General...` set keyboard increment to 1px  
* In `Preferences > Units...` change everything to pixels, and update `Guides and Grid...` to pixels too  
* Open the `Transform` tool palette, click the little menu button, and select `Align New Objects to Pixel Grid` ([read more about this option here](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/pixel-perfect.html) – you'll probably want to turn this off when you're done)  

You can use multiple files for your different screens, but setting up several artboards in one file will probably be easier. Like InDesign, Illustrator also allows for Graphic, Character, and Paragraph Styles. If you want a challenge, trying to use these across your design (see [this tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/graphic-styles.html) for more info).

### FOR THURSDAY, MAY 4  
For next week, please continue to work on your app designs, arriving at a prototype that can be shown to the class. These should be printed on paper, and can include annotations in the margins about how something will be seen or interacted with. Next week, we'll do a small-group feedback session "trying out" your apps, critique your Print-on-Demand Books, and talk about creating video documentation in Keynote. (VA&T majors, please check that you have Keynote installed and that it's working ok.)

### FOR FRIDAY, MAY 12 (9am–1pm)  
**Note that we'll be meeting in the VA&T Lab, not wherever is listed on the exam schedule!**  

For the final presentation, you should prepare a video in Keynote demonstrating your app design. The video should be your presentation, showing us your screen designs, give us a sense of the overall design choices, and demo your animated elements. Feel free to use things like label text, arrows, simulated interactions, and an intro screen to better explain your app. Be as specific about your transition and timing choices as you were about the app itself – the video is, in the end, your final design.

When finished, export as a video at `1080p` (see below for other settings). Be sure to play it and make sure everything looks right, then upload to Canvas titled `LastnameFirstname_AppDesign.m4v`.
