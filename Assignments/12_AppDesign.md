APP DESIGN
====

>"Indifference towards people and the reality in which they live is actually the one and only cardinal sin in design." ― Dieter Rams

For our final project, we're turning our attention from print to screen. Your assignment is to design a mobile app for a graphic design festival put on by [American Institute of Graphic Artists](http://www.aiga.org/) (AIGA). You'll need to think about the paradigms we discussed around books, as well as new affordances offered by the screen, as well as how interactive elements connect, non-linear viewing, and dynamic and animated elements, all while building a beautiful, graphically-satisfying (and perhaps visually challenging) design.

For your final deliverable, you'll be creating a video in Keynote that shows the interaction in your app. This should show:

* A clear, concise description of the app and the design solutions used to arrive at this design  
* At least three screens that serve different functions, and the transitions between them  
* At least two interactive or animated elements in your app  

### PROJECT CALENDAR  
**April 13:** Project launch and [design sprint](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/blob/master/Exercises/DesignSprint.md)  
**April 20:** Screen mockups and interaction diagrams due; animated elements  
**April 27:** Critique of print-on-demand books; project updates due; Keynote demos for interactive mockups  
**Exam Period:** Projects due, final critique

### FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 13  
This week, we'll build on the [design sprint ideation](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/blob/master/Exercises/DesignSprint.md) we did in class, and end up with some screen mockups and interaction diagrams. Start with paper or the whiteboard as a way of doing quick ["paper prototyping"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping) – speed of iteration is much better than fancy graphics at this point. As Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn said: "If you're not embarassed by the first version of your product, you released too late." You can use the printed templates given out in class, and print more from [the PDF here](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/blob/master/Resources/PhoneTemplate.pdf) (also in the `Resources` folder).

In addition, map out the elements of your app into an [interaction diagram](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/uiFlowDiagram.htm). This should show the pages, transitions, interactive elements, and how everything ties together. This is about mapping logical, non-linear pathways through your app, and creating good user experience. A good way to figure this out is to actually "play-test" your paper prototypes, seeing how someone would actually use your app. You can design your diagram by hand, so long as it can be clearly read, or in Illustrator.

As you're working through this project, you may find Apple's [resources for interface design](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/) very helpful. Their priorities for good interfaces: aesthetic integrity, consitency, direct manipulation, feedback, metaphors, and user control.

**DELIVERABLES FOR NEXT WEEK**  

* At least 20 screen mockup drawings, hand-drawn or printed  
* At least one finished interaction diagram, also drawn or printed  

### RESOURCES  
* [PDF phone template](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/blob/master/Resources/PhoneTemplate.pdf) used in class  
* The outline of our [design sprint](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/blob/master/Exercises/DesignSprint.md), which may be useful at other stages of this project  
* Some articles on interaction diagrams from [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/4697.html) and [Agile Modeling](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/uiFlowDiagram.htm)  
* [This excellent animation](http://giphy.com/gifs/10-principles-of-motion-design-3oriOiLUqWXA9Rc7eM) showing principles of motion design  
* If you want to get further into the design sprint/Agile Development model, see [this article](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) on "user stories"  
* [This article](http://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design) is an excellent introduction to interface animation  
* More on the idea of [skeumorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph), and [why you might use it (or not)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/skeuomorphism-is-dead-long-live-skeuomorphism)
