{SOMETHING}PUNK BOOK
====

**DUE THURSDAY, MARCH 9**

[Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk), [seapunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seapunk) ([see also](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/seapunk)), [vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave) ([see also](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/vaporwave)), and other internet-based subcultures are a mashing of two or more disparate aesthetics into something new. The result is almost always visual, auditory, and weird – colors, materials, shapes, styles, histories, artifacts, and language get sourced and remixed into a form that is both an homage to the source but greater than the sum of its parts.

Your assignment over the next two weeks is to invent a {something}punk or {something}wave genre (fill in the blank with a word of your choice) and make a visual book celebrating it. It can/should include texts and images borrowed from elsewhere, but the overall style should be a new mashup. Like the Design Elements book, this is meant as an over-the-top visual celebration.

In addition, your task is to think about the design challenges a multi-page book presents: ideas that unfold over time, the act of turning a page, the physical size of your book, the weight of the paper, how you can build suspense or surprise, and clarity and consitency (or lack thereof) across the entire project.

No need to worry about the practicality of commercial printing here: embrace materials, processes, whatever you want to make an amazing book that exemplifies your newly-minted genre.

While working, think as well about this kind of historical/cultural remixing in relationship to [postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) and what it means for a colonial culture like ours to borrow in this way? Are there things it's ok for you to borrow (if any?), and things that it wouldn't be? How does that influence your decisions as a designer? How can you reconcile or problematize that in your project?

###TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS  
Your book should:

* Include at least 12 pages (made up of 3 pieces of paper, folded in half)  
* Designed to be printed on 1/2 of letter paper minus 1/4" bleed all around (see the screenshot below)  
* Two copies of your finished book, printed and bound using a method that makes sense for your book

Above are the settings you'll want for a half-letter-sized book: 5 x 7.5" pages, no gutter or margins, 1/4" bleed. This will give you enough room to trim and account for page creep.

###FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 9  
For next week, please finish, print, and bind your book. You will want to give yourself enough time for a few printed iterations, making tweaks as you see them in real life. Please think about all visual elements of your book – paper choice, size, and method of binding – as part of your design. We'll look at your finished books at the start of class next week.

The stapler and guillotine are the Fab Lab – check the sign outside for open hours.

**PRINTING INSTRUCTIONS**  
Printing your book will require a bit more setup than a normal print. InDesign's `Print Booklet` feature can do some really complex printing, but with that comes more options. (Note, if you don't have InDesign on your computer, see the **File Export For Printing** instructions below.)

1\. Go to `File > Print Booklet...`, select *2-up Saddle Stitch* and set creep to 0.

2\. Click on the `Print Settings...` button. Choose the Phaser printer from the dropdown. Select landscape orientation and center page position – these will ensure your pages line up when printed.

3\. In the `Print Settings` dialog, click the `Printer...` button. Select `Two-Sided` under Xerox features (or the little checkbox) so your book automatically prints in duplex. You may need to enable this dialog in `System Preferences > Printers & Scanners > Xerox Phaser > Options & Supplies > Options...`. Click `Print` to exit this window. Click `OK` to exit the `Print Settings` window.

4\. Back in the `Print Booklet` window, check the preview tab to make sure everything looks right, then hit `Print`. Your book should print automatically with pages in the right order – easy, once you get used to it!

**FILE EXPORT FOR PRINTING**  
If you are using the Lab computers and can't print from them, you'll need to export your spreads as print-ready PDFs, then print from your laptop.

1\. Follow step #1 in the instructions above.

2\. In the `Print Settings` dialog, choose `PostScript File` as the printer and the `Xerox Phaser 7100N` for the PPD.

3\. Choose the landscape orientation for the paper under setup (like shown in the screenshot) and *Crop Marks* in `Marks and Bleed`.

4\. Hit OK to save the PostScript file (a precursor to the PDF format, used in printing).

5\. This file can be opened in Preview or Acrobat Distiller for printing – run as two-sided prints like we've done before.

###FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 2  
For next week, you'll gather visual source material for your project and create a sample page spread for your book in InDesign. Find and print at least 20 photos, screenshots, or other visual material that relate to your proposed genre. They can be found on the internet, created yourself, photographed from the real world, scanned or photocopied, rubbings, etc. Organize them into a neat, printed presentation that fits with the style of your genre – single-sided only though (so we can pin them up and look at them) please!

Please also bring all your tools next week, especially your bookbinding awl, thread, and needles. We'll be doing some sample binding ahead of the final version of your {something}punk book, and look at some other binding tools like the pamphlet stapler and guillotine.

Finally, please read the excerpts from *Design and Crime* (Foster) and [*10 Principles*](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design) (Rams) located in the `Readings` folder, and think about their perspectives on design, ornament, decoration, and sparsity. Write up a 2-3 paragraph response and [post it as an "issue"](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Design2/issues/new) in this repository under the title `Firstname Lastname: Foster/Rams Response`. Take a personal, critical stance – how do you feel as a designer? Bold positions, carefully considered, are especially encouraged.

###RESOURCES  

* Having trouble coming up with ideas? I built a [little {something}punk generator](http://jeffreythompson.org/somethingpunkgenerator/) to make it easer  
* See also genres like [retrofuturism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofuturism), [dieselpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieselpunk), [trillwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_rap), and [cyberpunk derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_derivatives#Other_proposed_derivatives) stonepunk, clockpunk, nowpunk, elfpunk, mythpunk, dreampunk, atompunk, and cyberprep (these are real things)
