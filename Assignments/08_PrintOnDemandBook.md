PRINT ON DEMAND BOOK
====

As our last book-related project, we'll expand to a larger-scale, culminating in two deliverables: a 60+ page print-on-demand book, and a hand-made book documenting your process. This project is all about scale, working on something with lots of pages, lots of text, lots of ideas, and figuring out how to put them together into a cohesive whole.

Your book should include text, whether one long piece or several shorter ones, for a total of at least 60 pages. The choice of text is up to you, but best would be to choose ones that you're personally interested in. Consider pulling from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) using the `Plain Text UTF-8` download, though you could scan and convert to text in Acrobat. (Note that many Project Gutenberg texts have weird [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) typos and you may need to proof your text.)

In addition to the selection of text, the visual structure of your book and any extra content (like images or graphical elements) are also up to you. As you plot what will go in your book, consider these lists ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design), [2](http://www.barbaradoyen.com/book-publishing/anatomy-of-a-book-the-contents)) of book elements for ideas, as well as our book research in the library.

Alongside the book you're designing, you'll be keeping a "process book" for this project as you go. This gathers source material, inspiration, type samples, photos of your process, etc into a single, presentable place. It's meant to show how you got to the finished design, especially choices or process that wouldn't otherwise be obvious from the final product.

###PROJECT CALENDAR  

**March 23:** research, texts, and brief due; critique with Design 3  
**March 30:** spread mockups due; PDF export for printing, ePub and screen PDF output  
**April 6:** process books due, send project to printer; critique with Design 3, print vs screen paradigms  

###TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS  
Your book should:

* At least 60 pages long in printed form, though longer is ok  
* Designed for the Blurb [trade softcover in 6x9" size](http://www.blurb.com/trade-books)  
* Contain texts of your choice (can be from anywhere); images and graphics are optional but should be of your making (not pulled from online, please)  
* Black-and-white is fine, color optional (and more expensive)  
* Finished book printed online using Blurb (please plan for this expense)  
* Printed and bound process book documenting your work  

###RESOURCES  

* We'll use the [Blurb InDesign plugin](http://www.blurb.com/indesign-plugin) to make the design process a little easier  
* [This list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design) of book elements (and [this one too](http://www.barbaradoyen.com/book-publishing/anatomy-of-a-book-the-contents))  
* More info on the [Blurb trade books](http://www.blurb.com/trade-books)  

###FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 23  
Over the next two weeks, your first step will be to reserach your book. You should think about what text(s) your book will contain (and read them, of course), and work on gathering visual research that will inform the look and feel of your book.

**VISUAL RESEARCH**  
Start by gathering visual materials: images that relate to the text, font samples, screenshots, photos of books you have/find or other design projects that are inspirational, etc. Crop them as necessary to focus on what's important or interesting to you. These will be included in your process book – more is definitely better here! Aim for at least 50 images, but 100 would be even better.

Save them to a folder on your computer at the highest resolution possible, and be sure to note what they are and where you got them in the filename or a notes file. (We'll go over this in class, though you should try to find a methodology that works well for you.)

**PROJECT BRIEF**  
Using your research and gathering as a jumping-off point, please create a project brief for the book. This should include:

* A description of the contents of your book (what text are yo using, what other things are you planning to include?)  
* Intended audience – who are your readers, who would buy this?  
* A list of at least 20 words describing what you want your book project to feel like  
* At least 4 possible font samples and a description of why they fit well with your project (be specific!)  
* A curated selection of visual research images (can be arranged several on a page, if you want)  
* A paragraph or two on how your visual research relates to your chosen text, and how you plan to incorporate elements from that research in your finished project  
* Anything else you think relevant to describe your project  

A brief is a professional document intended to pitch and describe a project: it should be well-designed and make sense in the context of the project. Print your finished brief – **single-sided only, please** – and bring it to the next class. We'll do a feedback session, then have a critique with the Design 3 students.

**BONUS!**  
If you have some time over break (I know, I know) and want to spend a lovely book-based afternoon in the city, you could:

* Take the PATH into 14th Street  
* Visit [The Strand](http://www.strandbooks.com), a gigantic used bookstore in Union Square (find, photograph, and measure tons of new and old books!)  
* Hit up some of the many antique bookstores in that area too  
* Walk up to [Printed Matter](https://www.printedmatter.org/) in Chelsea, home to hundreds of amazing small-run artist books and other unique publications  
* Grab some lunch (and a beverage) at the Half King, then hit some Chelsea galleries before heading back home
