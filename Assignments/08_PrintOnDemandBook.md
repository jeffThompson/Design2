PRINT ON DEMAND BOOK
====

**NOTE! Due date changed, to give you a little more time ☺️**

As our last book-related project, we'll expand to a larger-scale, culminating in two deliverables: a 60+ page print-on-demand book, and a hand-made book documenting your process. This project is all about scale, working on something with lots of pages, lots of text, lots of ideas, and figuring out how to put them together into a cohesive whole.

Your book should include text, whether one long piece or several shorter ones, for a total of at least 60 pages. The choice of text is up to you, but best would be to choose ones that you're personally interested in. Consider pulling from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) using the `Plain Text UTF-8` download, though you could scan and convert to text in Acrobat. (Note that many Project Gutenberg texts have weird [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) typos and you may need to proof your text.)

In addition to the selection of text, the visual structure of your book and any extra content (like images or graphical elements) are also up to you. As you plot what will go in your book, consider these lists ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design), [2](http://www.barbaradoyen.com/book-publishing/anatomy-of-a-book-the-contents)) of book elements for ideas, as well as our book research in the library.

Alongside the book you're designing, you'll be keeping a "process book" for this project as you go. This gathers source material, inspiration, type samples, photos of your process, etc into a single, presentable place. It's meant to show how you got to the finished design, especially choices or process that wouldn't otherwise be obvious from the final product.

### PROJECT CALENDAR  

**March 23:** Research, text selection, and brief due; critique with Design 3; master pages, paragraph styles, flowing blocks of text  
**March 30:** Spread mockups due; cover files, PDFs for professional printing  
**April 6:** Critique with Design 3, finish Blurb-ready books and process books for next week  
**April 13:** Finished process books due, send project to printer; print vs screen paradigms discussion  

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS  
Your book should:

* At least 60 pages long in printed form, though longer is ok  
* Designed for the Blurb [trade softcover in 6x9" size](http://www.blurb.com/trade-books)  
* Contain texts of your choice (can be from anywhere); images and graphics are optional but should be of your making (not pulled from online, please)  
* Black-and-white is fine, color optional (and more expensive)  
* Finished book printed online using Blurb (please plan for this expense)  
* Printed and bound process book documenting your work  

### RESOURCES  

* Sample text (in plaintext format, ready for InDesign) from Agatha Christie's *And Then There Were None* is in the `Resources` folder (or [just click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffThompson/Design2/master/Resources/SelectionFromAndThenThereWereNone_AgathaChristie.txt))  
* We'll use the [Blurb InDesign plugin](http://www.blurb.com/indesign-plugin) to make the design process a little easier  
* [This list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design) of book elements (and [this one too](http://www.barbaradoyen.com/book-publishing/anatomy-of-a-book-the-contents))  
* More info on the [Blurb trade books](http://www.blurb.com/trade-books)  

### FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 6  
Continue working on your books! We won't have a formal check-in next week, but a good milestone would be to have everything roughly laid out, plus a start on your cover. You should also work on gathering up materials for your process book and start thinking about how you want to structure that.

### FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 30  
This week, you'll start designing the layout of your book in InDesign. You should use this time to experiment with the overall look and feel of your book, and get really picky about the typographical choices you're making. We'll be focusing on just a few spreads to start (rather than the entire book) to make iterating quicker, but [Paragraph Styles](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/paragraph-character-styles.html) will make expanding to the full book easy.

For next week, you'll design:  

* [Frontispiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_frontispiece) (optional) and title page  
* Spread of two pages, including chapter/section headers (if you're including graphical elements or illustrations, include them here)  
* Spread of some other part of the book – could be table of contents, index, a special callout, etc  

**Please bring at least two variations of each of these spreads. They can be small adjustments or radically different versions, but it should give us something to look at and discuss concrete options.**

Be sure to use [Paragraph Styles](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/paragraph-character-styles.html) to define how the different elements look – we'll copy those settings over to your finished book. Doing things by hand now will make your life a total pain later.

Books are about being really, really (really) picky – adjusting something a fraction of an inch one direction or the other can make a huge difference. Get serious about your design decisions, but don't let that keep you from trying bold ideas, weird layouts, and experimenting with the book form. Take breaks, print out versions and pin them up.

**LAYOUT**  
Your spreads should match what the final book's layout will be. In this case, it's determined by Blurb, but I've unpacked it for you:

We'll generate the full book template next week, using the [Blurb InDesign plugin](http://www.blurb.com/indesign-plugin). Adjust your margins from the Blurb minimum to what feels right, based on your book measurements in class.

**PRINTING**  
You should export the spreads you're printing as PDF files and print them on the laser printer. First, go to `File > Export PDF...` and choose `Adobe PDF (Print)`. Be sure to select `Spreads` instead of pages, and `Crop` under `Marks and Bleed`. You may get a warning about *overprinted text* but you can ignore it.

Then you can print your PDF on the laser printer. Since two 6x9" pages won't fit on 11x17" paper, you'll need to have the printer resize them to fit.

### FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 23  
Over the next two weeks, your first step will be to reserach your book. You should think about what text(s) your book will contain (and read them, of course), and work on gathering visual research that will inform the look and feel of your book.

**VISUAL RESEARCH**  
Start by gathering visual materials: images that relate to the text, font samples, screenshots, photos of books you have/find or other design projects that are inspirational, etc. Crop them as necessary to focus on what's important or interesting to you. These will be included in your process book – more is definitely better here! Aim for at least 50 images, but 100 would be even better.

Save them to a folder on your computer at the highest resolution possible, and be sure to note what they are and where you got them in the filename or a notes file. (We'll go over this in class, though you should try to find a methodology that works well for you.)

**PROJECT BRIEF**  
Using your research and gathering as a jumping-off point, please create a project brief for the book. This should include:

* A description of the contents of your book (what text are yo using, what other things are you planning to include?)  
* Intended audience – who are your readers, who would buy this?  
* A list of at least 20 words describing what you want your book project to feel like  
* At least 4 possible font samples and a description of why they fit well with your project (be specific!)  
* A curated selection of visual research images (can be arranged several on a page, if you want)  
* A paragraph or two on how your visual research relates to your chosen text, and how you plan to incorporate elements from that research in your finished project  
* Anything else you think relevant to describe your project  

A brief is a professional document intended to pitch and describe a project: it should be well-designed and make sense in the context of the project. Print your finished brief – **single-sided only, please** – and bring it to the next class. We'll do a feedback session, then have a critique with the Design 3 students.

**BONUS!**  
If you have some time over break (I know, I know) and want to spend a lovely book-based afternoon in the city, you could:

* Take the PATH into 14th Street  
* Visit [The Strand](http://www.strandbooks.com), a gigantic used bookstore in Union Square (find, photograph, and measure tons of new and old books!)  
* Hit up some of the many antique bookstores in that area too  
* Walk up to [Printed Matter](https://www.printedmatter.org/) in Chelsea, home to hundreds of amazing small-run artist books and other unique publications  
* Grab some lunch (and a beverage) at the Half King, then hit some Chelsea galleries before heading back home
