WOOD TYPE EXPERIMENTS
====

> "[We] no longer talk about digital versus analog but instead about modulations of the digital or different intensities of the computational." – D.M Berry

While we may live in a time when apps and websites make up much of our daily experience, the most exciting results tend to happen when we explore the cracks between things. Continuing our play with materials and process, in the next few weeks we'll be creating letterforms via a back-and-forth between physical and digital, constantly converting between the two.

After a series of mark-making experiments in class, you'll design letterforms digitally, we'll mill those into wood using a CNC router, print them, scan the prints, and create a poster. The goal of this project is to explore type as a highly mutable and expressive tool, and to explore how physical materials and processes can inspire design work that would be impossible with just the computer.

**DUE THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16**

### REQUIREMENTS  

This project will several deliverables over the next three weeks:

* Hand-drawn mark and letterform experiments  
* Three vector letterforms  
* Milled wood type and printed letters  
* Finished, printed poster design – should be 11x17" with a 1/4" margin, and use a complementary font chosen to go well with the one your design  

All of these materials should be turned in at the end of the project, so please save everything as you go. Remember that presentation and craft counts towards your grade, so keep everything in a safe place.

### PROJECT CALENDAR  

**Feb 2:** Project assigned, create vector letter design  
**Feb 9:** Scan letterform, create poster in Illustrator
**Feb 16:** Letterform poster due, start InDesign tutorials

### ARTISTS AND PROJECTS SHOWN  

* Tim Knowles' [drawings using trees](http://www.timknowles.co.uk/Work/TreeDrawings/CircularWeepingWillow/tabid/266/Default.aspx)  
* Yuichiro Katsumoto's [*Mojigen & Sujigen*](http://www.katsumotoy.com/mojisuji/index.html)  
* Lots of [wonderful calligraphy](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/search?keyword=calligraphy&type=objects) from the Brooklyn Museum online collection  
* Alphablox pieces to build letterforms (image above) and the Monoblox and Alphablox systems  

### RESOURCES AND FURTHER READING  

* Really want to know why picas and points were used to measure type? Get [your answer here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40345194?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)  
* A [wonderful, deep dive into rounded typefaces](https://www.fontshop.com/content/a-round-of-applause-for-well-rounded-type-talent-part-1), especially as they relate to wood type and the kind of pens used to draw letterforms  

### FOR THURSDAY, FEB 2

For next week, using your drawings as inspiration, create a set of three vector letterforms. The letter/symbols you choose is up to you, though it would be useful to think about which letters might best represent your typeface. You should also think about the limitations of the CNC mill – corners will be rounded and super fine detail is not possible, as it might be with a laser printer. Instead of limitations, try to see this as a design challenge and something that will guide the aesthetic.

**Please design your letters to fit in a 3.5 x 3.5" block, next to each other, in a single Illustrator file. Bring your file and a laser print of your letterforms to class.**

Please also wear clothes you don't mind getting messy (or an apron). We'll be printing with ink, and though we hopefully won't make too much of a mess, better safe than sorry.
