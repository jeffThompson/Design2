WOOD TYPE EXPERIMENTS
====

**DUE THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16**

> "[We] no longer talk about digital versus analog but instead about modulations of the digital or different intensities of the computational." – D.M Berry

While we may live in a time when apps and websites make up much of our daily experience, the most exciting results tend to happen when we explore the cracks between things. Continuing our play with materials and process, in the next few weeks we'll be creating letterforms via a back-and-forth between physical and digital, constantly converting between the two.

After a series of mark-making experiments in class, you'll design letterforms digitally, we'll mill those into wood using laser cutter, print them, scan the prints, and create a poster. The goal of this project is to explore type as a highly mutable and expressive tool, and to explore how physical materials and processes can inspire design work that would be impossible with just the computer.

### REQUIREMENTS  

This project will several deliverables over the next three weeks:

* Hand-drawn mark and letterform experiments  
* Three vector letterforms  
* Lasercut wood type and printed letters  

Finally, a laser-printed poster design:  

* 11x17" with a 1/4" margin
* Use a complementary font, chosen to go well with the one your design, describing your typeface  

All of these materials should be turned in at the end of the project, so please save everything as you go. Remember that presentation and craft counts towards your grade, so keep everything in a safe place.

### PROJECT CALENDAR  

**Feb 2:** Project assigned, create vector letter design  
**Feb 9:** Jeff out of town – no class! Work printing your letters and your posters...  
**Feb 16:** Printed letterform poster due – bring all materials listed above to class, start InDesign tutorials

### ARTISTS AND PROJECTS SHOWN  

* Tim Knowles' [drawings using trees](http://www.timknowles.co.uk/Work/TreeDrawings/CircularWeepingWillow/tabid/266/Default.aspx)  
* Yuichiro Katsumoto's [*Mojigen & Sujigen*](http://www.katsumotoy.com/mojisuji/index.html)  
* Lots of [wonderful calligraphy](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/search?keyword=calligraphy&type=objects) from the Brooklyn Museum online collection  
* Alphablox pieces to build letterforms, and the Monoblox and Alphablox systems  

### RESOURCES AND FURTHER READING  

* Really want to know why picas and points were used to measure type? Get [your answer here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40345194?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)  
* A [wonderful, deep dive into rounded typefaces](https://www.fontshop.com/content/a-round-of-applause-for-well-rounded-type-talent-part-1), especially as they relate to wood type and the kind of pens used to draw letterforms  

### FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16  

For next week, the final part of your assignment is to create a type specimen poster, showcasing your typeface. Unlike a bland sample of a typeface online or in Font Book, a specimen poster is meant as an expressive, creative way of presenting your letterforms.

* You should incorporate your scanned letters, plus an additional typeface with a text describing the qualities of your typeface  
* Think about repetition, scale, heirarchy – all the basic design elements  
* Print your poster at 11x17" before class on the Lab laser printer, or off-campus  
* Please also bring your ink experiments, print block, and printed letterforms so we can hang a small exhibition  

See the **Project Requirements** section above for technical details on size, etc.

**BRING NEXT WEEK: please bring all of your tools to class – we'll be making accordion books.**

### FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2

For next week, using your drawings as inspiration, create a set of three vector letterforms. The letter/symbols you choose is up to you, though it would be useful to think about which letters might best represent your typeface.

**Please design your letters to fit in a 2 x 2" block (changed from what we talked about in class, but we can resize later so don't sweat it), next to each other, in a single Illustrator file (like in the image above).**

Please also wear clothes you don't mind getting messy (or an apron). We'll be printing with ink, and though we hopefully won't make too much of a mess, better safe than sorry.  

### IN CLASS  

During class, you will want to:

1. Lasercut your letters  
2. Do some printing on the press  
3. Start picking a matching typeface for your poster  
4. Ideate/draw poster layouts  
5. Work on writing a description of your typeface for your poster  

### PREPPING YOUR FILES FOR CUTTING  

We need to do a few things to get your letterforms ready for the lasercutter.

1. Be sure your document is the right size: 2 x 6" – **note the size change!**  
2. Add a single black background to your entire document and change your letters to white (be sure the black is `rgb(0,0,0)` and not just the black swatch)  
3. *Optional: create three separate black squares with minimal margin around your letters to save time on the lasercutter – your block won't look quite as nice, but it's quicker to cut*  
4. Merge any shapes making up a letter into a single shape (`Pathfinder > Merge...`)
5. Flip your type! When we print them on the press, they'll get reversed (`Object > Transform > Reflect > Vertical...`)  
6. Save your document as a PDF file
