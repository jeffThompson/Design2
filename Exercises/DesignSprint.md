DESIGN SPRINT
====

Today we'll be running a "design sprint" (or part of one, at least) as a way of generating ideas for a project. This process, developed at Google for their Google Venture incubator, is about opening a group's mind to new ideas, then coming up with solutions. Design sprints are also about making "evidence based" choices – using observations and testing to determine the best design decisions. While usually run with groups of designers and developers, we'll use the design sprint in class as another tool for design ideation, and ignore the messy details of technical implementation ☺️

We'll roughly follow these steps below.

### 0. DEFINE THE PROBLEM  
The first step happens before the sprint, and outlines a "challenge statement," which in this case is the assignment, and includes a list of deliverables.

### 1. UNDERSTAND (THE CHALLENGE)  
The first step, before thinking about solutions, is to understand the challenge. As a group, quickly and without worrying about how 

* What is foundational to this challenge? What absolutely must be accomplished?  
* What is useful and delightful to the user?  
* Think of stories related to the project? What experiences have you had, or would like to have?  
* Come up with "how might we...?" questions.  

Your group will gather up as much of this as you can, then synthesize it into a 2–3 minute "lightning talk" on your findings.

### 2. DEFINE (A STRATEGY TO PURSUE)  
With a sense of the challenge, we can now start to think about strategies to pursue. These aren't quite solutions yet, but form a direction to head in.

* As a group, come up with opposites that define choices for the project. These could be design-related like **Geometric vs Organic**, or about experience, such as **Fun vs Work**.  
* As a whole class, we'll combine our sliders, then place dots along them to think about where this project lands in this context.  

### 3. DIVERGE  
At this stage, we split into either individuals (in our case) or smaller teams. This gets lots of voices in the mix, avoids people from directing the conversation too much, and ensures that all ideas are equally heard.

**CRAZY EIGHTS**  
For this exercise, fold a piece of paper into eight equal sections. In five minutes, quickly sketch out 6-8 ideas that might apply to the project. These can be big, small, visual, technical, etc – anything goes. Try to make your sketches legible and add labels if necessary, but don't worry about great ideas at this stage. After sketching, we'll do silent dot-voting – everyone gets 3 dots each, so use them wisely! 

For the second round, everyone will take a point of view to approach the project from. These include:  

* Pessimist  
* Optimist  
* User advocate  
* Idea generator  
* Technical feasibility  
* New user  
* Power user  

After both rounds, we'll split up again and start working on some paper prototypes.

### 4. DECIDE and 5. PROTOTYPE  
The next steps, which you'll do for your homework, is to decide on a way forward and create prototypes. The goal here is to be just good enough to get the idea, but not about perfection.

### 6. VALIDATE  
Our final step is to test with real users, in this case your fellow students. Using your paper prototypes next week, you'll get feedback from everyone on your app's design, helping you improve your design and think about next steps.
